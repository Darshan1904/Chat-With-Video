[Music] welcome to Ecom insiders podcast my name 
is Debi and this event is being sponsored by   SPCTEK today's topic is going to be the latest 
changes to Amazon's AI algorithm and my guest's   name is Jon Tilly he's the CEO of Zone Guru John 
is the co-founder and CEO of Zone Guru which is   a technology tool set that can help e-commerce 
Brands and agencies scale on Amazon through data   intelligence and automation um it was launched in 
2016 and it was their Vision was just to create   a set of operational tools that could focus on 
solving Amazon Seller challenges um that delivered   the most impact on scaling revenue and profits and 
and before Zan Guru JN spent 15 years working as   an advertising advertising strategist for some of 
the top digital agency in Jo Johannesburg London   and Los Angeles in 2014 he launched multiple 
successful private labels on Amazon and that   started his path to where he is today so welcome 
John we're excited to have you thank you debie   uh appreciate that introduction yeah the the the 
accent is is definitely South African originally   uh but I'm here in Los Angeles so Jon I am really 
interested in today's topic because I know very   little about some of Amazon's AI algorithms 
so I'm hoping that you can teach me as much   as you teach everyone else all right so tell me 
a little bit about how you feel like Amazon's AI   algorithms have evolved over the years yeah uh 
this is a this is a topic which is been really   interesting for sellers over the years um you know 
at at a high level um you know what sellers are   trying to do is understand how is the Ai algorithm 
Amazon's algorithm technology how is it um how   is it getting information from your product your 
your your storefront and how is it then assessing   that information and then giving you organic 
visibility to get in front of customers right   and and at a high level think about it Amazon's 
business model they want to make sure that they   are getting the latest greatest best products in 
front of customers when they're searching for a   product so uh not necessarily always the product 
that's selling the most but you know they in for   longevity of of a business they want to make 
sure that when customers are searching for a   product a water bottle whatever it is that 
they are going to get surfaced you know the   the latest Cutting Edge product that is of good 
quality that's going to W their their customer   and get them to enjoy the experience and then go 
back and repurchase Etc right so that's what the   algorithm is trying to do now we we have certain 
IND indications from Amazon as to what they are   looking for and importantly over the years what 
are they looking for that matches their business   model right are they looking for the latest gr's 
newest products better high quality you know um   things that are moving through their their 
inventory fast that have great cter health because   that's going to give them more profit at the end 
of the day selling price Etc right so so they look   at all these factors and and the Dynamics of that 
have changed over the years um and it's a black   box right so as Sellers as technology third 
party service providers we don't have insight   into exactly what that algorithm looks like um and 
we've just got to you know use our our testing our   abilities our understanding of technology to 
figure out hey what what are they actually and   people that we know on Amazon side hey what are 
they actually looking for and then and then move   move forward on that so um over the years it's 
been a little bit mysterious like well they have   you know all this great amazing technology in 
the algorithm but at the end of the day it was   pretty straightforward engineering math right it 
was um hey what what is the what are the various   Search terms that customers are searching for on 
the products what are they how do you find them   and then you know how do you from a mathematical 
perspective put that into your listing uh and and   they would rate uh you know whether keyword that 
that customers are searching for exact matches or   broad matches somewhere in your listing um and 
if there was a conversion of a sale that came   from that there would be additional juice that 
would go to the algorithm so that was from the   content piece but then there were other factors 
that that that are also part of that so how   much are you spending on PPC what's the health of 
your storefront how many ratings you have reviews   what's your what's your uh rate of return um 
you know all of these various aspects that would   help Amazon to identify hey do you have a great 
product that you can sell but more importantly   do customers really like it and are they getting 
a great experience when they buy that product so   all of that stuff goes into um or did go into the 
algorithm now now it's definitely changed over the   years but I'll I'll stop there for a second and 
as a matter of fact that brings me to my next   question what are some of the most Rec everyone 
thinks AI is like just started right and AI has   been around for a long time and the companies have 
been using it but what are some of the most recent   things changes that you're seeing in the Amazon 
AI algorithm yeah I mean that's a really good   point AI has been around for a long time we've 
been using algorithmic Engineering in in our   products for years and and it was certainly done 
for years before that right with with all with all   products I think I think from a from a customer or 
a consumer perspective now ai just become you know   something that we we all use in our day-to-day 
consumer lives with chat gbt right but in terms of   what AI is it's been around for a long time and we 
and we develop it over time so yeah yeah you right   you're right is is AI has been a big component of 
Amazon's algorithm for a long time um and you know   there is this the latest conversations have been 
around this idea of you know is is the algorithm   driven by just keywords and what keywords you 
have in your listing and how that matches an   indexes for and and if the algorithm sees that you 
index for that in your content therefore it will   surface your product based on its assessment of 
of your performance as as a and quality of your   product um and then there's this idea of like oh 
well the big changes is now becoming more semantic   so it's it's starting to infer hey based on what 
your product is your product category the type   product yeah you might be indexed for these 
keywords right now but the the AI is starting   to infer and say hey you're part of this product 
category and we know these are additional keywords   that you should index for or Surface for based on 
what people are typing into Amazon therefore uh   we'll we index you for that as well and show you 
based on that and that was like maybe six months   ago and I was like oh it's more semantic and 
and our feedback on that was like it's always   been semantic right you you could go back two or 
three years and you could type in if if I've got   the keyword if my product is a blue shoe um a blue 
soccer shoe and and I didn't have blue soccer shoe   in my listing but if I if I really was selling 
well I could type in blue soccer shoe and I would   still appear on Amazon's you know search results 
right so the point is like our job as as sellers   or or or um and this is more familiar now with 
people today is like our job as sellers is to   to provide input you know as a PR to the algorithm 
so giving it the best keywords everything that we   need the right indicators those are all prompts 
to the algorithm to then make decisions on how   you surface we don't need to write and solve the 
problem for the AI in terms of exactly how it's   going to put everything together and be semantic 
and everything all we need to do is give our best   shot of like hey here has all the prompted 
information you guys then make the decisions   as an AI as to how you need to surface it but 
we need a prompt it in the best way possible   and that's our job with sellers right yeah so I 
know when we are correcting listings and stuff   like that and and we're looking for keywords 
a lot of times that the sellers have created   their own listing they're not as familiar with how 
important those keywords become in the search and   the search algorithm and stuff like that um so we 
talked a little bit about the search algorithm but   are there different types of AI algorithms that 
are being used by Amazon yeah so um yeah I want   to kind of Carry On from your last point which is 
like where is the so that's kind of where it was   and where is the algorithm and the AI going um you 
know in you know there's been a lot of involvement   very recently you know uh in terms of what we're 
exposed to in the last six months right what one   being Cosmo which is which is uh you know Amazon's 
AI algorithm and and the way it's starting to look   for or or Surface your products based on you know 
um more behavioral in ENT type of of searches um   and and and exploring sorry I'm just going to mute 
this for a second uh and exploring um you know   what what the what what are what a what is even a 
broader type of uh search universe that customers   might want to uh the customers might be typing 
for and how can we surface those products so AI is   taken a much more uh expanded way of of being able 
to surface products and that's not just based on   keyword that might be based on experience like hey 
I'm going camping what do I need right and trying   to look at how that's going to evolve the actual 
search experience on Amazon and that's also led   to one of the latest products which is Rufus right 
and and Rufus is only it's been ineda for a while   uh in in the US but now as part of your consumer 
app experience Rufus is available which is the AI   assistant shopping assistant that is available 
on uh you know on Amazon and uh that's pretty   interesting uh you know you can do it today you 
can actually go on your your Amazon seller app and   instead of typing in a keyword to and surfacing 
storefront results you can actually ask roffers   a question and go back and forth with ruus and it 
will take you through an an Engaged uh shopping AI   assistant experience which is completely outside 
of the normal shopping experience that you have   and that is really interesting and what ruus 
is looking for is quite different to the normal   algorithmic uh keyword research that that Amazon 
is doing so it's it's it's going to start saying   things like I can go like hey what are some really 
good products to take when I'm camping it's going   to give you some results I can then ask back and 
forth questions just like I do with chat gbt and   can get more and more refined in their results I 
can go like hey what do you recommend it will then   surface specific products so you can have a whole 
experience on Amazon right now without even going   to a shopping page for for a number of uh prompt 
questions and and what ruus is looking for and how   you make sure that your that at the end of the day 
your keywords and your and your content on your   product page matches what what ruus is looking 
for that is a step that's been taken in a while   that we really have to answer um and we can get 
into how we answer that but but part of that now   is not only content in your listings but it's how 
is Rufus reading your images it's not just looking   htl tags andm is actually reading the content in 
your images and is that image content filling what   ruus is actually looking for or should it should 
the continue images be slightly different to be   able to answer the questions that Rufus is is 
looking to fill the gaps with so it's taking a   lot more uh you know beyond the the you know it's 
just you know it's it's treating ruus more as like   a human aspect of what it's actually looking for 
in your listings and Rufus is actually in Amazon   tool Rufus is the name given to Amazon's AI 
assistant okay the storefront right now and   where that search bar is it'll say Hey you can 
search or you can type a question so just like   you would do with chatu VT today and consumers 
are doing this more and more you would just type   in there you wouldn't go uh you know blue water 
bottle for camping instead of me putting that   into Amazon and seeing what the results are I 
would put in hey what what what are some great   uh you know blue water bottles that I could use 
for camping and and uh you know cycling uh and   what do you recommend right so you're having 
more of a conversation rather than typing in   a specific keyword to get a result and so what it 
then surfaces it's going to say Hey you know for   camping there's actually these great bottles but 
also you can use it for these things what else do   you want to know and then you would have that the 
normal AI engagement part and so that Evolution on   Amazon is leading to a lot more different ways of 
making sure that you can optimize your listing and   that's where we're seeing where Amazon is going 
which is yes content in your listings what are   you putting your back in Search terms you know 
EBC A+ premium contents what are you actually   writing what those second through seven images 
and in your A+ content what are the benefits that   you're including in your copy because it's 
reading that now and and that fees what the   algorithm is looking for how do I look Beyond just 
uh search intent words and look at more Behavioral   um you know words these are important things 
that that that because of the capability of   the AI being a lot broader in terms of you know 
coverage of of different ways that you can use a   product you need to make make sure you're feeding 
that to the algorithm so do you think that these   changes obviously will impact the Amazon seller 
is it going to be the way that they write the   listing that they're now not going to be keyword 
focused but they're going to be more you know   benefit focused yes I think I think that is uh an 
important piece right so you can this is this is   a a so we we have in zonguru we have a a chat BT 
we were the first in the space to to launch an AI   integration into our listing optimization tools 
called you know chat gbt we're on chat chat gbt   4 Omni right right now um but you know what we're 
constantly testing is what are the prompts that   we're giving chat gbt and and how do we finesse 
those further based on keywords but also it was   originally just keywords like hey what are the 
right kind of keywords and and let's write the   the the content in the way that is best matched 
to the algorithm which to your point you can as a   seller you can write content all day but if you're 
not writing it with the right structure you're   not maximizing the potential SEO benefit you got 
from your listing so number one you need to write   the listing in the right way but that's evolving 
further right now which is not just like hey these   are all the key and how we write the content but 
it's expanding that further into hey this is the   general Universe of keywords that that and in the 
product but how do we what are some of the other   different behavioral types of ways of this product 
being used what are some of the other additional   intent ways of doing it and then feeding that 
also into the into the chat BT to then come up   with the right kind of content so your content and 
how you you write your bullets your descriptions   your back and Search terms being a little bit 
more bro context is critical right now because   you know that's the kind of stuff that that the 
the um Rufus and and Cosmo are looking for and   in addition to that understanding now not just on 
the content of your piece but for your images yes   your images are there to to drive conversion right 
which is hey we need to tell a story everyone's   buying by looking at the images and we've always 
been really good at what our content goes into the   images but it's even more important now because 
that cont content that goes into your images is   important to help with the conversion and to tell 
the story of the product which is your number one   thing but actually what's even in those images is 
is is the AI is reading that now and using that to   infer you know what what what you know what you 
should be ranking for so um you know it's much   more apparent today that not only the content 
in the listing but your your images the content   that's in the images also feeds into the algorithm 
yeah I've also noticed that AI is now taking the   product reviews and kind of pulling out main 
bullet points to summarize you know the totality   of all of the reviews and stuff like that um what 
other kinds of changes like pricing I mean product   recommendations what are other kind of changes 
that you're going to see because of AI yeah I   think I think um you're right so reviews is a big 
piece that there's Fe that questions and answers   any any information now that that that helps 
to give the the AI a fair reflection on what   the market and what customers are looking for and 
what they think about your product is important   so it's feeding a lot more of like not just like 
hey what do we think we should put in front front   of customers what are customers actually um 
looking for and that is evolving into uh and   where it's going to go is is more of a personal 
recommendation of Me John Tilly and what are my   uh personal preferences what is my um uh you know 
search history what is my um purchase history and   that feeding into rius and Rufus being smarter 
about what it's going to recommend right it knows   that I only wear uh you know you know prefer you 
know men's large XL shirts or whatever it is so   it's G to it's going to feedback that into into 
my uh listings Etc so you know those are things   that are going to help evolve it um um to not 
just be hey you know this is what I'm searching   for and this is what the market is recommending 
but these are recommendations I'm giving based on   your actual personal preferences your profile um 
and and uh expanding on that right and um you know   that evolves into not just searching for specific 
products but events um hey you know you you're   going away on this weekend you know these are you 
know what you know do you have everything you need   or is there anything else that you're looking for 
and you have some recommendations it's going to   evolve into that much more experiential um type 
of of experience right so do you think that these   changes will actually address maybe some potential 
biases that might have existed in some of the   previous versions or we're still going to see 
PPC and some of that type of stuff play into the   product that's pulled into your you know viewing 
yeah I mean I think I think those biases are   always going to be there and I think that's one of 
the biggest challenges of Amazon as it evolves as   as a as a industry leader is you know we've always 
seen over the years that Amazon is actually you   know all the mistakes that Google made as they 
grew Amazon is kind of all the mistakes and wins   that Amazon sorry that Google has made over the 
years Amazon is kind of like three or four years   behind that and they're doing all the same things 
right so Google went through that whole phase of   like hey we have a great search results page 
oh we're making money off PPC let's push more   PPC ads great we're making so much more money oh 
but hold on now the the customer experience is   starting to get impacted so we need a dialback 
PPC give organic more of a position how do you   find that right balance so that yes we making as 
much money as God wants us to make you know or   or or investors or whatever it is and and that's 
a big driver but at the same time you know we've   got to make sure that we're still holding on to 
the customer experience because if that starts to   really get impacted they're going to start to lose 
market share and and customer eyeballs right so so   Amazon's in that place right now where like in the 
last two three years they're like oh good we can   make so much money off PPC and and they are um but 
they've got you know everyone's like oh he organic   going to go away no ways it's it's actually GNA 
you know they have to get that balance right and   and they're going to have to because that's 
you know that they can't impact the overall   customer experience so so yes there's going to be 
more richer organic customer experience type of   engagements and they're always going to surface 
the best Greatest Latest newest products because   they have to because customers are going to want 
to be able to see that um and there's always going   to be a paid element hopefully knock on wood they 
start to get the balance right there so that it's   not overwhelming from it's not taking away that 
bias is not overwhelming and taking away from   The Core Essence of what we're trying to find on 
Amazon as customers right so um they're certainly   going to you know as the the AI assistant gets 
more integrated um there's going to be a paid   aspect on that as well which is like okay Ruf 
is going to say this but hey if you want to   get into that experience you're going to pay some 
money right so they're going to build that in for   sure at some point but hopefully they get the 
balance right so that it's you know the customer   is still going to benefit from The Experience so 
do you what do you think that Amazon would need to   do in order to ensure maybe some transparency 
and explainability of its AI algorithms for   people who've been accustomed so long to really 
basing it on the keywords and stuff like that is   Amazon doing a good job of just explaining what's 
going on with these updates no no they're not yeah   um and and you know that that's I guess why why 
we we have a place in the market as third party   service providers um is that you know it's our 
job as Engineers as data people um to you know   as as experts in Amazon uh and the algorithm as 
to try and infer hey what what do it need to to   help grow um and we we do get feedback internally 
from Amazon you know uh in terms of where they're   going uh what what potentially the alch is looking 
for and how we can improve that so you know that   is our job um what I would just say to sellers 
is is like you know don't get too stressed out   about it right like like oh my goodness the whole 
thing's going to turn like our business gonna get   turned upside down no it's not right at the 
end of the day you have to do your best job   of of creating amazing products and communicating 
that amazing product to your customers and and the   good thing is that is that Amazon is starting to 
lean more on hey tell the best story you can you   don't have to overstuff keywords you don't 
have to do whatever you write your listing   professionally you show amazing products you tell 
the story and you deliver an amazing product with   a great experience and and that should be enough 
for us to then take that and and sell products   through and you know don't get returns and just 
have a high good health score rating and if you   can do a good job on that you know you're you're 
gonna you're gonna um you know you're going to   tell the algorithm what you needs and you're 
going to surface in the right way right so   that's what we can do now now obviously there's 
tricks and things that we need to do around that   but at it's 80% you need to you need to you 
know you have to deliver a great product and   communicate in a great way if you do that there's 
20% around that that can help you get the growth   but sellers get mixed up on that and they're like 
oh I've got a crappy product and I'm going to push   it out there and I'm G to take all these hacks 
to try and improve it and that's that's where   they full down right so you kind of answered my 
next question I was going to ask you um how can   the small businesses really optimize their product 
listing but when you said to tell a story I think   maybe that's the most appr appropriate way to 
tell people how they can benefit from Amazon's AI   you know it's been so really just those keywords 
short keywords long tag you know all of that type   of stuff that people have been doing and I kind 
of like the fact now that we're really getting   back to the principle of the product and what the 
product does how it benefits you the value of the   product all of that type of stuff so if you're 
missing information or you have incomplete data   in your product listing um will AI still be able 
to identify the opportunities for that product   potentially but I think the challenge there is to 
say hey don't leave any opportunities off of the   table right so your your your job as a seller is 
number one to have an amazing product number two   is to have stock and number three is to have and 
and number three is to have an amazing listing   that that is telling the story but is also written 
in the way for what the algorithm is looking for   so there is a technical piece to that right and so 
that's where technology like ours come into place   like you can write an amazing listing and you can 
put it up there but in terms of the structure of   that listing you know how you exact broad match 
for keywords how they go into your listing um   have you got all the keywords that is covering the 
universe of what's looking for do you have all the   intent use case is covered the behavioral intent 
use case is covered um you know have you got that   in the right place you're listing bullets backend 
images you know there's all those technical pieces   that need to be solved for and what's good about 
AI on our side um and chat gbt is that we can   technically prompt AI how to do that and we can 
say hey write a story about this but write it   with the right structure so that you know in 
a minute you're getting the right structural   way of optimizing your listing that you can then 
finesse further and then put put into into place   in your in your listing so you know you have the 
right structural optim ation with with all those   use cases covered um so that you're giving your 
listing the best shot of of uh you know getting   the maximum traffic and conversion and then your 
job is to use you know everything else that Amazon   gives it to you promotions Lightning Deals um 
you know PPC Etc drive traff to and sell well   let's say that I am a seller on Amazon and I'm 
thinking oh I probably do need to integrate some   AI what are your best practices I mean and do 
you find that there are also AI tools out there   that aren't effective that people are just jumping 
into Ai and don't really know what they're doing I   mean tell us a little bit about some of the best 
practices that we can use to ensure that we have   best optimization for AI yeah I think um one of 
the biggest advantages we see um between how we   are creating content for listings versus someone 
who just goes there and and use a chat TBT Etc is   the the the inputs that we're giving so you know 
it's the same thing right chat TBT is is a is an   output of a result based on the questions that you 
ask it and you know today in your daily practice   if you're asking chat gbt a silly question you're 
G to get a silly answer and it's about how smart   you are with your questions and maybe you know how 
it itative you are on the questions that you ask   where you really start to get am aming content so 
like it might take four or five questions to get   amazing content from chat TBT the same thing 
happens uh on on writing content for listing   for listings if you don't have the right inputs 
the right data inputs to then prompt the right   smart questions to chat tvt to give you the right 
answers that's where your shortcoming is right and   so we're in the position right now where we know 
based on our our apis the intelligence that we can   get from Amazon we know all the types of keywords 
that customers are searching for on Amazon what   are the most relevant ones you know what are the 
different use cases what is you know what is um   Rufus looking for in images is that covered you 
know what are some of the be you know all of those   different pieces we know what those are and we're 
collecting all of that and then prompting the the   the output content solution that covers it and 
structurally writing it the right way based on   what the algorithm is looking looking for so if 
you don't know that backend piece that's where   um you know some tools are falling short or if 
you're just a seller on your own going to chat   you're going to fall short because you're getting 
content that might not cover every use case or   keyword and certainly they might not be put into 
the listing in the right way um to maximize every   sale opportunity that comes off of those keywords 
so it it matters if you're paying uh if you're   buying AI tools that really are within Amazon 
versus just using any AI tool out there um it   it matters on on how you prompt those tools so you 
use you can use whatever you want but if you don't   have the right information to prompt it you're 
not going to get the right result right and so   you know we we we test today like hey what is if 
I ask Rufus a question what are the answers going   to give me and we ask chat gbt the same kind of 
question and with a bit of um you know styling of   that finessing we can get a very similar result 
so you know it's it's it's about um you know the   type of questions and the information that you 
have and how you prompt uh the AI to get a result   and then and then the other piece that I think is 
really interesting with our tool versus any other   ones is we don't just tell you hey you know let's 
say you write a piece or you use our AI tool or   whatever you want but like when you have a final 
piece of of content right we'll give you a rating   on that content Hey how well is this matched to 
what Amazon's algorithm is looking for will give   it a score out of thousands right um we don't 
just tell you what that score is we allow you   to upload your major competitors and we'll tell 
you what that score is as well so you know the   it's twofold one is like Hey how do I have the 
best listing but number two is it better than   any other listing that's out there so that I know 
that I'm maximizing my potential on Amazon and   we answer both those questions so you can kind of 
scratch at it which is like okay well it's telling   me I have a great listing but is it really the 
best listing while I I can look at my competitors   and and I know that I have a better listing than 
them I'm always concerned about account Health   can AI generated product descriptions or titles 
kind of inadvertently lead to policy violations   like misleading claims exaggerated benefits or 
even some of the prohibited terms uh yes so I   think I think again it goes to the questions that 
you're going to ask of AI and so you know the the   important thing is there is like for instance in 
our tool right you can you can prompt AI hey write   this content but you can also prompt the AI to 
say hey don't write about these content or these   keywords right so as the experts right you can 
tell the AI hey we know our category and we know   that these are certain terms that will trigger the 
AI will trigger Amazon to to ban us or whatever it   is do not include these pieces of content um and 
for the most part AI is going to get it right the   second piece is we're not creating AI to replace 
uh agencies content writers experts who understand   what needs to go on Amazon we're there to to give 
you the fastest best Baseline that can then be   checked and finessed further before it gets posted 
on Amazon so there always needs to be that human   element of like AI is a great brainstorm and it's 
going to do things much faster and get you where   it needs to be but like certainly if you're just 
taking that and posting it directly to Amazon   without checking it you know you're fundamentally 
or finessing it you fundamentally falling short   right so um our job is to give you the best 
you know what's the worst thing for a writer is   starting with a blank page if we can give them an 
amazing Baseline in under a minute that they can   then check against their knowledge and expertise 
and finesse further and tweak it a little further   that's where that's where you win right it seems 
like uh John you're always like one step ahead of   me I was actually going to ask you should sellers 
maintain human oversight in their product listings   and you went right to it um so if a seller wants 
to Leverage The Power of AI to improve let's say   customer satisfaction or even minimize negative 
impacts can they do that for their account Health um I don't know the answer to that 
I think in terms of you know um can   they get insights as to what customers are 
looking for and what what you know what's   going to improve their satisfaction 
yes absolutely um you know uh and and understanding where that content comes from 
from reviews from questions and answers you   know and and finding what those pieces are and 
then feeding that to your your content creator   whether that's AR or an individual is is is 
great we have a we actually have a tool which   has been around for some time which does use AI 
um you know previous to chat gbt come out which   is called LoveHate which is uh a word card uh you 
know simulation around positive and negative uh   review sentiment uh and and then surfaces that 
right so that you can look at that for product   differentiation for listing content Etc so um yes 
like any any you know we're just getting smarter   and smarter with um how we can connect and and get 
data from our our customers our target audience   or icps whatever you want to call them and then 
it's how you use that content um you know that   that's going to you know uh improve improve what 
you know how you can connect with that customer   emotionally and and you know with with with 
what's in your product now um what's our job   as humans our job as humans is like if everyone's 
going to get a great Baseline because everyone's   going to use Z Guru and they're all going to 
have amazing listings well that's 90% of the   picture you've just saved yourself you know two 
hours writing a listing from scratch so spend 15   minutes or 20 minutes at least you know putting 
your expertise into there to take it to 110% and   don't just be like oh well I'm going to leave 
it at 90% so our job as humans is then to say   hey we've got an amazing Baseline so now let's 
really focus on our creativity our expertise to   make that thing even better and that's the beauty 
of like what Ai and data does is like it pushes   us as humans to just not be lazy but focus in on 
our creativity and our expertise right so use that   stand outs right yeah now if sellers want to stay 
informed about what's happening with Amazon's AI   um how would they do that where do they ensure 
that they know what's going on well uh I mean   they can they can connect to our newsletter we're 
always updating in there um you know and obviously   uh you know our customer base they get informed 
uh with what's happening in the space um I would   say definitely there are a few uh newsletters 
out there it's obviously been somewhat of a a   growing Trend again for the last year but there's 
some really great newsletters out there that that   sers can connect with um I would say that's 
probably at a high level the the thing that's   informing best is and and fastest is like you know 
just be connected to the industry there always um   now whether those uh content pieces are true uh is 
another story but uh it will start to guide you as   to hey where where is um you know where Where is 
the what what is the latest Trend coming on right   um but this has been a you know a challenge 
always right which is that there's always a   shin object object syndrome what is out there is 
it actually something that's going to move the   needle or not and that's you as an entrepreneur 
seller you need to rely on like what's the 8020   or what's moving the needle for my business and 
use that filter right yeah now will you see much   talk on seller Forum about L um Amazon's 
AI are there people talking about it there   all the time you know people are constantly trying 
to figure out like hey how how do I how do I how   do I know what the AI is looking for and how do 
I gain the system and and you know what needs   to be done um you know at as I said at the end 
of the day you you shouldn't be too distracted   by that um you need to focus on on what the 80% 
is which is like you know a great product great   listings great health you know great business 
practices if you do that well you're going to grow   um there's certainly um newsletters and there's 
there's internal groups like million dollar seller   Club you know as a seller being connected more to 
those and finding out like some of the the smart   strategies which is the 20% outside of the 80% of 
what you're doing those are really helpful at the   end of the day but you know people just need 
to recognize that without any of those things   there's still 80% that you need to do with your 
business to win uh and and if you're struggling   it's probably because you haven't got the 80% 
right it's not the 20% that you don't know about   yeah yeah well if you were going to give a final 
piece of advice to Amazon sellers and I will tell   you I've been on your website and I loved it when 
I saw the love haate I I just thought some of the   category or some of the headers and stuff like 
that you guys did a great job um of making it   kind of fun as well as you know it's a business 
but what kind of final piece of advice would you   give to Amazon sellers to just navigate through 
all of this AI that's going on the platform um   I've been in this game a long time from a from 
an Amazon industry perspective I think you know   my long time uh maybe it's specifically Amazon 
and Amazon selling is probably back to 2013 so   you know a fair amount of time and you know what 
was said to me when I started looking at Amazon   is like oh so much harder right now you know it's 
there's no opportunity anymore you know the good   old days was was last you know last year um you 
know we could just put anything and and sell it   um and that's just always a common theme right and 
so you know you're going to hear it today oh the   algorithm is changing it's so much harder to sell 
right now than it always been like the opportunity   is gone it's all a bunch of you know it's going 
to be the people are making money Handover F all   the time launching brand new products finding 
opportunities uh you know it becomes harder   you have to rely on data more you have to be more 
sophisticated ated in your business Acumen um but   the market is growing there's more opportunities 
today than there ever has been to make money on   Amazon to grow a business to get things going it's 
an amazing opportunity um and you just have to you   know follow the right business practices and yeah 
it might be a little hotter but there enlar your   Moes as well to being successful so you know um 
don't be discouraged and and certainly um you know   if your if your head's going to the place like 
it's hotter than it's ever been and it's not worth   it it's probably you're not doing the right job or 
tapping into the right opportunities because they   they really are there for for any type of seller 
whether you're a big brand or or smaller store   smaller sellers you've just got to look for the 
right type of opportunity yeah I'm always amazed   by the number of people who come to us they're 
they're ready they found their product they want   to get started you know they think that the minute 
that they get on Amazon they're just going to   start see the sales rolling in because they don't 
really think of it they think it's an easy task   you just jump on Amazon and you just start to 
see sales and they don't really take advantage   of the fact that or even into account that it's 
a business and you are going to have to hone your   craft you know you don't open a restaurant and 
just the doors everybody's there the first day you   have to start getting people in to say oh they're 
good they put out reviews that type of stuff it's   the same thing with Amazon it's not as easy as 
every little uh commercial commercial that you   would see find the next $10,000 product you know 
um so I just from our perspective sometimes make   sure that people understand there's an initial 
investment and it's just like any other business   you got to educate yourself there's time that goes 
with it and you're going to probably have to put   some money and you're going to have some months 
that you don't make a lot of money because you're   going to be reinvesting in other product and that 
type of stuff so I think um one of the messages   that I try to tell people is you know be realistic 
in your expectations when you're on Amazon um just   like you said it might not be as easy but there 
are some things that are getting easier you know   it's it's a give and take type of a a thing and
